    So what im going to talk about is more about them. The first one is my dog lala and the other reason why i put her on here was because she was my first dog/puppy i have ever got for me. She was calm and chill at first but like 4 days later she was verry energetic always liked going outside liked playing and she would always try to eat my moms french bulldog food. My moms french bulldog and Lala will always play together she is very speacial to me✨.
    Next is Jose so me and jose met on club day in 6th grade we was in video game club and we was both playing fifa and he was kinda quite but we would laugh together and i remember him texting me on instagram and we would just keep talking and talking and we became real friends so fast i would tell him about my problems and he would help me out and give me advice and when i would have problems with a person he would defend me and we both had girlfriends that were bestfreinds too and we would say we are the better duo but we are not with them nomore they sill are bestfriends and me and Jose are still bestfriends and the better duo🔒3/23/22.
    Next is Juan and Jose so me and juan was new to scool we wouldnt talk at first and it would be akward when they put is together but me and him became so close so fast like like around the end of school i trust him with so much he was there for me and still is and he swithched schools around kinda the end of 7th grade but i would have problems with a ex he would give me so good advice he was my go to advice person or to tell him chisme and he can tell when im mad or sad and he would always ask me if okay and how i been fr shout out to him love him and trust him ♾️💙 
    Next is jocelyn the last but wont be my last to go to tell her chisme😭. So me and jocelyn met in 6th we had classes together but mostly everything happend in ELA she would always help me out and let me copy🤞🏾 but we became so close in 7th i swear we would always make fun of people and joke around and we would always make fun of eachother but we wouldnt take it personal and fr she was there when i needed someone i would tell her so much chisme and she would agree with my desiciouns she was and still is the only girl i trust and is my best friend and she would always tell when im mad ot thinking she would tell me if im mad and i would say No and she would always keep asking me if i was mad 😭 Me and her are really are 4lifers✨
